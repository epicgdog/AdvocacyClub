            <p> Here at Advocacy Club, our mission is to be a platform for those who feel their voice isn't being heard.</p>
            <p> For example, we have this man explaining how to find the "Among Us" within pi. </p>
            <video width="100%" controls> <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
            <p> Such ideas like these would be brutally repressed especially on sites like Twitter. At advocacy club, ideas like these will be shown in the spotlight, sparking debates and discussions if this idea is even practical in the first place. </p>
