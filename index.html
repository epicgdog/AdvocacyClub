            <h3> What is Advocacy Club? </h3>
            <p> Here at Advocacy Club, our mission is to be a platform for those who feel their voice isn't being heard.</p>
            <p> For example, we have this man explaining how to find the "Among Us" within pi. </p> 
            <!-- can put video in its own div for resizing -->

            <!-- testing a comment-->
            <video width="100%" controls> <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
            <p> Such ideas like these would be brutally repressed especially on sites like Twitter. At advocacy club, ideas like these will be shown in the spotlight, sparking interesting debates and discussions </p>
            <p class="note"> NOTE: ideas must be school appropriate. </p>

            <p class="note"> NOTE: We check each application, making sure you are not joining this club just to troll. </p>
