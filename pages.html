              Pencils are a staple in school. From tests to art projects, they are used in a variety of ways. 
              There is also a variety of types of pencils, ranging from cheap, wooden <i> Ticonderogas</i> to more 
              expensive mechanical pencils from <i> Pentel</i>. However, are these mechanical pencils really worth
              the price?
          </p>

          <p>
              First of, we'll take a look at the cheap, wooden <i> Ticonderogas</i> that I mentioned earlier. 
              These pencils are necessary for taking Scantron, AP, SAT, or pretty much any standardized tests. These tests
              are necessary for passing classes, gaining college credit, and even getting into that dream college you want to go to.
              Another advantage these pencils carry is their price. <i>Ticonderogas </i> come in packs that cost around $3 for a pack of 12. That means
              each pencil only costs $0.25 but there are even cheaper options than this. Because their price is so affordable, people are able to buy multiple packs, 
              meaning pencils that get lost aren't a big deal, unlike losing a mechanical pencil. Though prices are cheap and these pencils are used in important tests, 
              <i> Ticonderogas </i> still have drawbacks. For example, let's say you have run out of eraser at the end of a pencil. 
              This means you either have to a) get a new pencil b) buy an eraser top or c) remove the metal protector to reveal even more eraser. 
              All of these solutions uses resources one might now have. Moreover, you continue to damage the environment by buying more and more of
              these pencils. <i> Ticonderogas </i> are made with wood, and wood comes from trees. Trees are necessary for the planet to digest excess CO2 and fart out O2.
              Without trees, it would be impossible for us to live. By buying more and more of these pencils, trees are being chopped down and leaving more CO2 in the air than normal. 
              Thus, the greenhouse effect occurs, warming the planet. This dramatic warming has caused numerous, dangerous wildfires here in California, as well as 
              torrential rains that flood cities in Asia.
